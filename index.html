    <p>As part of my Computer Science A-level CourseWork, I was tasked to make a final project demonstrating all my knowledge accummulated over the Computer Science A-level Course,</p>
    <p>I wanted to challange myself and hence i decided to make a game of Billiards in Python.</p>
    <p>I made it using the PyGame Library, which ended up posing a lot of challanges, as PyGame does not have a physics engine of it's own, and therefore i had to homebrew all physics needed.</p>
    <p>Some of the challanges i facerd include: Balls not colliding properly with the border and with other balls, I solved this by creating a pseudo Hitbox that checked if there is anything inside twice the radius of a ball.</p>
    <p>This issue arrised due to PyGame's inbuilt collision system checks if the center of the ball was colliding with the center of anything else.</p>
    <p>Another challange I faced was the border collisions not working properly, this was mainly due to a missunderstanding of how the PyGame Canvas displays given values. </p>
    <p>After reasearching the PyGame Documentation, I found out that the 4 parameters taken by the rectangle object were (top,left,height,width), and then hotfixed it.</p>
    <p>Overall, the project was a success and it took roughly 5 months to complete</p>
