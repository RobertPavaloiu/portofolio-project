        <p>As part of my Computer Science A-level CourseWork, I was tasked to make a final project demonstrating all my knowledge accummulated over the Computer Science A-level Course,</p>
        <p>I wanted to challange myself and hence i decided to make a game of Billiards in Python.</p>
        <p>I made it using the PyGame Library, which ended up posing a lot of challanges, as PyGame does not have a physics engine of it's own, and therefore i had to homebrew all physics needed.</p>
        <p>Some of the challanges i facerd include: Balls not colliding properly with the border and with other balls, I solved this by creating a pseudo Hitbox that checked if there is anything inside twice the radius of a ball.</p>
        <p>This issue arrised due to PyGame's inbuilt collision system checks if the center of the ball was colliding with the center of anything else.</p>
        <p>Another challange I faced was the border collisions not working properly, this was mainly due to a missunderstanding of how the PyGame Canvas displays given values. </p>
        <p>After reasearching the PyGame Documentation, I found out that the 4 parameters taken by the rectangle object were (top,left,height,width), and then hotfixed it.</p>
        <p>Overall, the project was a success and it took roughly 5 months to complete.</p>

        <img src="todo.png" alt="Image of To-do list">
        <p>This is a To-Do List app, which I made during my Software Engineering apprenticeship Bootcamp as a means to learn and practise Vue3 (Raw). </p>
        <p>The app allows a user to view previous to-do list entries as well as add new ones and delete completed ones.</p>

        <p>In my final Bootcamp Project, I had to make a joint effort project. Me and my teammate decided on making a game inspired by wordle where you guess a video game.</p>
        <p>If you guess correctly you win, and if you guess wrong you will get info about the game along with whether the game's info matches with the correct game's information.</p>
        <p>The information provided for each game was the game's: Genre, Publisher, Year of Release, Platform, Players, and Camera Perspective.</p>
        <p>If the information of the guess matches the correct game's it turns the circle green, otherwise it will be red,</p>
        <p>except for Release Year, which if within 3 years of the correct guess it would turn orange.</p>
        <p>We made this project possible using Vue 3 with Composition API and TypeScript for frontend and C# for backend, and SQL for Database where my main focus was the Frontend.</p>
        <p>This Project was a great learning Experience, as I got a hands on experience of Vue3 Composition API as well as working in a team.</p>
        <p>This was by far my most advanced project at the time of making it.</p>
        <p>This project took 2 weeks to complete and it features 111 games to choose from as guesses.</p>
